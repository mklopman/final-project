# FAN FINDER APP

## USER STORIES

“I’m a Washington Nationals fan living in LA… And one of my favorite things to do is actually go to baseball games, but I had nobody to go with. Then I got on Fan Finder, connected with some other Nats fans in the area and because Fan Finder also has a SeatGeek widget, we were able to get tickets to a game and go together!”

“I’m a Boston sports fan living in Chicago, so my teams aren’t on TV that often here. So I was going to the bar across the street a lot to watch the Celtics games or I’d find a way to stream it in my apartment. But that got pretty lonely. I was sure there had to be some Boston fans in the area who were dealing with the same issue. Then I found this Fan Finder app and connected with a bunch of other Boston fans and now I have a crew to watch with!”

“I currently live in San Diego — I know… Awesome right? — but not surprisingly, there aren’t a lot of Pittsburgh Pirates fans around here. But because of the Fan Finder, when the Pirates come to town, I’m able to go to the games with the few Pirates fans around!”
