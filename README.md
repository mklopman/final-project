# FAN FINDER APP

## APPROACH

I wanted to help out transplant sports fans a little more with this app. I took my Sports Bar Finder idea and put a community twist on it. 

If you’re a Chicago sports fan living in San Francisco, it’s probably tough to watch your teams on TV and it might get a little lonely out there. But what if you could reach out to other Chicago fans in your area, meet up with them and watch the games? Or even go to the games with your new friends? Wouldn’t that be fun?

So this app allows transplant sports fans connect with fans of the same team, in the same area, and share experiences watching their teams together -- whether it's at a local sports bar or a new friend's apartment. So  I thought this app would be perfect for connecting sports fans everywhere. 

## USER STORIES

“I’m a Washington Nationals fan living in LA… And one of my favorite things to do is actually go to baseball games, but I had nobody to go with. Then I got on Fan Finder, connected with some other Nats fans in the area and because Fan Finder also has a SeatGeek widget, we were able to get tickets to a game and go together!”

“I’m a Boston sports fan living in Chicago, so my teams aren’t on TV that often here. So I was going to the bar across the street a lot to watch the Celtics games or I’d find a way to stream it in my apartment. But that got pretty lonely. I was sure there had to be some Boston fans in the area who were dealing with the same issue. Then I found this Fan Finder app and connected with a bunch of other Boston fans and now I have a crew to watch with!”

“I currently live in San Diego — I know… Awesome right? — but not surprisingly, there aren’t a lot of Pittsburgh Pirates fans around here. But because of the Fan Finder, when the Pirates come to town, I’m able to go to the games with the few Pirates fans around!”
